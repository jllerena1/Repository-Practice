- [ ] Make multiple commits as you develop
- [ ] Push branch to GitHub
- [ ] Create a Pull Request
- [ ] Merge the PR after review

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix

- [ ] `git log` - View commit history
- [ ] `git log --oneline --graph --all` - View compact history with graph
- [ ] `git diff` - View unstaged changes
- [ ] `git diff --staged` - View staged changes
- [ ] `git branch` - List all branches
- [ ] `git branch -a` - List all branches (including remote)
- [ ] `git remote -v` - View remote repositories
- [ ] `git checkout -b new-branch` - Create and switch to new branch
- [ ] `git switch branch-name` - Switch branches
- [ ] `git add .` - Stage all changes
- [ ] `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with message
- [ ] `git push` - Push to remote
- [ ] `git pull` - Pull from remote
- [ ] `git pull --rebase` - Pull with rebase

---
